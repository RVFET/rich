Rich-go is a Go library for printing text in terminal in a more readable and eye-pleasing way. This library is meant to be a Go equivalent of the Python library [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) by Textualize.

> **Note**: This library is still in development and is not yet ready for production use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

To install Rich-go, you just need to `go get` it:

```bash
go get github.com/rvfet/rich-go
```

### Usage

Rich-go aims to be as simple as possible to use. Here is a simple example:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/rvfet/rich-go"
)

func main() {
  rich.Print("Hello, World!")
}
```

Common logging functions are also available:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/rvfet/rich-go"
)

func main() {
  rich.Info("Connecting to database...")
  rich.Warning("Connection timed out, retrying...")
  rich.Error("Connection failed!")
  rich.Success("Connection successfully established!")
  rich.Debug("Connection took 2.5s")
}
```

Rich-go also supports inline styles, arguments and nesteding. Here's a crazy example:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/rvfet/rich-go"
)

func main() {
	rich.Print("[x]Hello[/] [green][i]World[/] and its", 8, "[white]billion[/] [b]beautiful[/] [red]inhabitants[/]!")
	rich.Debug("This API [yellow]has to be[/yellow] [u]revised[/u] and [u]optimized[/u]!")
}
```

> **Note**: For icons to work, you need to have a font that supports them. You can use the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for this.

### üì¶ Roadmap

- [x] Basic text printing
- [x] Basic logging functions
- [x] Inline styles
- [x] Making Print and logging functions variadic
- [ ] Handling nested styles in a better way
- [ ] Implementing string formatting:
      `rich.Print("Hello, %s!", name)` or `rich.Print("Hello, {name}!")`
- [ ] Making monkey-patching easier and improving modularity
- [ ] Perhaps, a docs website?
- [ ] Config file for customizing styles
- [ ] Logging to file
